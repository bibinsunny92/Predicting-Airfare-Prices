Airline Industry is a rapidly growing, highly competitive sector and subject to drastic changes for even small changes in some critical parameters. Hence applying data mining process to decision making is very critical for the longer survival and success. Our primary objective is to deploy a model for one of the major Airlines in the US, to determine if they need to start operation to/from the newly opened airports and how they should price flights on these new routes. Analysis was based on the historical data collected from an airline on 638 air routes in the United States.

Various Machine Learning algorithms such as Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree, LASSO regression and Extreme Gradient boosting model were built and used to predict the price and finaaly there accuracies were compared to identify the best model.
